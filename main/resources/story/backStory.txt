You’ve been sentenced to 25 years for a murder you didn’t commit.
Your best friend’s wife is dead… and he framed you.
That morning, you accidentally left your phone at his house.
When you went back, the door was open. Blood on the floor. Her body.
Before you could speak, he walked in—and called the cops on you.
You ran.
While hiding, you discovered your phone had been recording everything…
including his confession.
But before you could show anyone, the police found you.
Now you’re behind bars, with no one on your side.
There’s only one way to prove your innocence:
**Escape. Find the phone. Expose the truth.**
